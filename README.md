# Speech-Recognition-project
🗣️ Speech Recognition with Python

This project demonstrates a simple speech-to-text system in Python using the speech_recognition library. It captures audio from the microphone, processes it in real-time, and converts spoken words into text using Google’s free speech recognition API.

🚀 Features

--> Records audio from the system microphone.

--> Automatically adjusts for ambient noise before recording.

--> Converts speech into text using Google’s Speech Recognition engine.

--> Saves audio input to a .wav file if recognition fails.

🛠️ Tech Stack

--> Python 3

--> speech_recognition library

--> PyAudio (for microphone access)
